# CharacterCraft
An extensive, all-encompassing role-playing plugin for Minecraft's server mod "Spigot / Bukkit"

NOTE: This plugin is under active development! I wouldn't bet anything on it actually working in its current form. I've uploaded it to GitHub simply to track my progress. 

## A Simple Introduction 
CharacterCraft sprung from the idea of having a large role-playing plugin that was free, or of extremely low cost, to the public. Where certain plugins, which will not be named, started charging comparatively large amounts of money for server admins to use or experience the full depth of their server mods, I will focus on giving back to the community without asking for much, or possibly *anything*, in return. This motivation comes from the idea that accessories to a rather cheap video game should not cost half, or more that half, of the cost of the game itself. 

## My Vision for the Plugin
In its current form, only about one to two weeks worth of work, this server mod is extremely lack-luster. However, in the coming month or two, great things will be added. Currently, I have a skeleton for most of what I am wanting to do. This will make implementing future concepts much easier.  

My plans include:
- 48 playable classes.
  1. This can be implemented fairly easily through skill specialization. For instance, if we started with a base *Warrior* class, depending on how the player focuses their energy into developing certain skills, e.g. their *strength* or *faith*, at a certain level, they will be able to specialize into a *Knight* or a *Paladin*, each with their own special spells, abilities, buffs and nerfs. 

- A LOT of Spells and Abilities.
  1. *Spells* will be used to modify the world around the player, or the players themselves, e.g. through fireball spells, teleportion spells, invisibility etc. While *Abilities* will focus primarily on buffing or nerfing player stats, e.g. draining a player's *strength*, buffing their *defense*, etc. I could write dozens of abilities, and quite the multitude of spells as well, as they would be very easy code. 

- 9 Main Player Attributes and 15 Skills.
  1. The main attributes affect player attributes like walk speed, damage taken from events, swing speed, overall strength, and much more. A couple of them affect things like spell duration, mana loss from spell casting, health regeneration, hunger speed, etc. Those are in contrast to skills, which affect in-game behavior like mining, fishing, enchanting, XP gain, etc. I may be able to add morem something along the lines of *alchemy* and the like, in the future.

- 5 Races.
  1. Each race will have its own set of passive buffs and nerfs, as well as a restriction on where they can build and what they can interact with. For example, Humans would not be able to effectively mine ores such as gold, redstone and diamond, or mine in general under a certain y-axis. While Dwarfs would be able to mine those or, but can't build above a certain y-axis. I feel like this kind of dynamic would not only force trade between players, but also force players to think more about the races they become.
